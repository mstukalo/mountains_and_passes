Some kml/kmz files with points for mountains and passes

Point in himalaya.kml are taken from Carter's Classification of the Himalaya (http://c498469.r69.cf2.rackcdn.com/1985/109_carter_himalaya_aaj1985.pdf)

Point in peak-opened-in-nepal.kml are taken from http://www.bochi-bochitrek.com/nepal-peak-climbing-list.pdf

Points in Westra folder are taken from http://westra.ru/passes/

Points in Himalaya/Nepal/Langtang are taken from different maps. [Langtang peaks and saddles most accurate.kml](https://github.com/mstukalo/mountains_and_passes/blob/master/Himalaya/Nepal/Langtang/Langtang%20peaks%20and%20saddles%20most%20accurate.kml) in MY OPINION is most accurate for now.
